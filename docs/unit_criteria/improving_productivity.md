#### 2.5 I can review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
- Candidates should compare final outcomes against initial requirements and success criteria
- They should evaluate whether the work meets the needs of the intended audience
- The review should include feedback from users or stakeholders where possible
- Evidence can include requirements validation documents, user testing results, or client acceptance documentation

#### 3.1 I can review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency
- Candidates should analyze how IT tools affected their productivity and efficiency
- They should identify specific benefits such as time savings, quality improvements, or resource optimization
- They should also identify drawbacks such as learning curves, technical limitations, or compatibility issues
- The review should include quantitative measures where possible (e.g., time saved, error reduction)
- Evidence can include productivity analyses, efficiency comparisons, or documented observations

#### 3.2 I can describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
- Candidates should provide specific strategies for enhancing productivity with IT tools
- They should explain how these improvements would address identified inefficiencies

- Evidence can include custom templates, automation scripts, keyboard shortcuts, or workflow optimizations

#### 3.4 I can test solutions to check that they work as intended
- Candidates should systematically verify that their productivity solutions are effective
- They should document the testing process and results
- The testing should include comparison with previous methods where possible
- Evidence can include test plans, before/after comparisons, or validation documentation

## Integration with Other Units

The Improving Productivity Using IT unit should be evidenced throughout all other units, with specific focus on:

- **Website Software**: Document how website development tools were selected to improve workflow efficiency
- **Video Software**: Compare different video editing tools and their impact on productivity
- **Audio Software**: Document audio file management strategies for improved workflow
- **Animation Software**: Document animation workflow optimization techniques
- **Digital Design and Graphics**: Document design template systems for improved workflow

For each unit, candidates should:
1. Plan and justify their IT tool selection
2. Review and adapt their approach during the project
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of their choices
4. Develop and test productivity improvements
