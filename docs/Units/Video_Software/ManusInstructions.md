## Important Documentation

For this task we are going to be focussing particularly on the files:

- `./unit_criteria/video_software.md`
- `./long_term_plan/long_term_plan.md`

## Task

In the repo listed above the curriculum documents for a new ICT-Content-Creation course I am running next academic year. It is a UK, Level 2 based qualification in ICT which I will be starting with Year 9 students. 

The long term plan suggests starting with the compulsory `Improving Productivity with ICT` module. I want to start with the `Video Software` module to get students excited about starting the course. With that being said, any criteria from the `Improving Productivity with ICT` module that can be evidenced in the `Video Software` module, should be.

The context for skills and projects should be based around content creation and social media. When looking at different parts of the video editing workflow during this unit, any real-world case studies from content creators or influencers your typical British 14 year old is likely to have heard of, who also produces age appropriate content would be helpful here. If there are youtube videos documenting their process to share with students, all the better. Due to the requirement for students to video footage, using 'faceless' accounts would be best to avoid privacy issues.

For the theoretical or digital skills based content, make sure the guides or instructions are as clear and accessible as possible as not all the students taking part in the course will be particularly technical. A bank of multiple choice quizzes with key words, phrases and definitions would also be helpful.

In a similar vein, cheat-sheets with guidance on things like aspect ratios, video compression formats and may be helpful in supporting students with their understanding as they work through the course.

The video editing skills be taught using Adobe Premiere Pro. Before attempting their portfolio piece, students should have a set of skills building activities teaching them the relevant premiere pro skills they need to be able to create an appropriate TikTok/Instagram reel artifact. Ensure that the skills are limited to the requirements and no more. 

Each week has 3 hours worth of content. Ideally, I would like each week to be a mix of practical lessons, where they develop video recording/editing skills and theoretical lessons, where learn about things like file formats, appropriate ways to set up scenes and so on.

All of this needs to be created with a view to creating a coherent set of lessons which will lead to students producing the required outputs for their course.
